# EE5311-Digital-IC-Design


This repository contains my work for the **Digital IC Design (EE5311)** course at **IIT Madras**.  Guided by Prof.Vineeta and Prof.Ramprasath
It includes SPICE simulations, schematic files, and analyses for CMOS circuits such as inverters, ring oscillators, and delay measurements.  
also Includes Layouts for 16Bit Ripple carry adder, Inverters.
Includes Reports for Waveforms, Delay analysis and STA.
